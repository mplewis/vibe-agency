# GAD-903: Research Topic Workflow (v0.8 First Artifact)
# ========================================================
# Workflow: Research Topic Synthesis
# Intent: Research and synthesize knowledge on a given topic
#
# The workflow demonstrates:
# - Multi-step knowledge discovery
# - Information synthesis and summarization
# - Semantic action composition
# - Practical value generation
#
# Version: 1.0 (Live Fire Ready)

workflow:
  id: research_topic
  name: Research Topic Synthesis Workflow
  intent: Analyze a research request, search knowledge sources, synthesize comprehensive report
  description: |
    Research workflow that produces actionable knowledge:
    1. Analyzes research request to extract key concepts
    2. Searches knowledge sources (web, databases, archives)
    3. Synthesizes findings into structured report

    This workflow demonstrates how VIBE generates business value
    by transforming requests into knowledge artifacts.
