notes: |
  CODE_GENERATOR is a sequential 5-phase workflow.
  Each task builds on artifacts from previous tasks:
  - Task 1 → validation_result.json
  - Task 2 → generated_code.json
  - Task 3 → generated_tests.json
  - Task 4 → generated_documentation.json
  - Task 5 → artifact_bundle (FINAL OUTPUT)

  The runtime must maintain artifacts across tasks
  and pass them between phases.
