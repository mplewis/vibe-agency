estimated_complexity: medium
estimated_tokens: 2000
estimated_duration: "15-30 minutes (includes negotiation if features rejected)"

notes: |
  This task may involve multiple rounds of negotiation if features are rejected.
  Critical for preventing scope creep and unrealistic expectations.
  Must load FAE_constraints.yaml before execution.
