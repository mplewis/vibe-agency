    critical: false
    used_by_tasks: []  # Not currently used by GENESIS_BLUEPRINT
    description: |
      Maps feature dependencies. Could be used in future for
      determining extension ordering/initialization.

# Knowledge resolution strategy
resolution:
  # How to handle missing required knowledge

  # How to handle missing optional knowledge
  missing_optional: "WARN"  # Continue execution, log warning

  # Cache knowledge files for this session
