# ========================================
# USAGE NOTES
# ========================================
usage_notes: |
  When VIBE_ALIGNER detects keywords matching a template:

  1. Suggest the template:
     "This sounds like a '{template_name}'. Typical features include: {...}"

  2. Let user confirm/modify:
     "Do these features match your vision? Any you want to add/remove?"

  3. Use as starting point:
     - Start with template features
     - User can customize (add/remove/modify)
     - Still validate with FAE/FDG/APCE

  Templates are SHORTCUTS, not rigid constraints.
  User can always deviate if needed.
