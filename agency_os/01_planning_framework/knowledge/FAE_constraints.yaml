      Ein 'Build'-Ansatz (Eigenbau) wird aufgrund extremer technischer Komplexität
      und prohibitiv hoher 3-Jahres-TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) nicht empfohlen.
      Die geschätzte initiale Entwicklungszeit (z.B. 10.2 Personenmonate) ist trivial
      im Vergleich zu den langfristigen Kosten und Risiken für die Wartung einer
      skalierbaren, zustands-synchronisierten Echtzeit-Infrastruktur.
    recommendation: >
      Verwenden Sie eine 'Buy/Blend'-Strategie unter Nutzung einer verwalteten CPaaS-API
      oder einer etablierten Open-Source-Lösung (z.B. Rocket.Chat, Mattermost).
      Dies reduziert die Time-to-Market von 8-14 Monaten auf 2-6 Wochen.
