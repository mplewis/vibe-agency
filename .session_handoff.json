    "   - Layer 2: Symbiotic file system (circular checksums)",
    "   - Layer 3: Enhanced git hooks (integrity + watermarking)",
    "   - Layer 4: Enhanced CI/CD (integrity gates)",

    "🎯 DECISION REQUIRED: Should we proceed with GAD-005-ADDITION?",

    "Option A: START GAD-005-ADDITION (5-week commitment)",
    "   Pros:",
    "   - Complete defense-in-depth security architecture",
    "   - Self-regulating system with integrity verification",
    "   - Production-ready for security-critical deployments",
    "   Cons:",
    "   - Large scope (120-150 hours over 5 phases)",
    "   - Security-critical (requires careful testing)",
    "   - May delay other roadmap items",
    "",
    "Option B: DEFER GAD-005-ADDITION to GAD-006 planning",
    "   Pros:",
    "   - Focus on core business value features",
    "   - GAD-005 baseline is already solid",
    "   - Can revisit when security requirements increase",
    "   Cons:",
    "   - Missing defense-in-depth (only 2 layers: MOTD + Kernel)",
    "   - No integrity verification (could be compromised)",
    "   - Less production-ready for high-security environments",
    "",
    "Option C: HYBRID - Implement Layer 0 only (Week 1)",
    "   Pros:",
    "   - Gets most critical piece (system integrity verification)",
    "   - Relatively small scope (1 week vs 5 weeks)",
    "   - Can add Layers 1-4 later if needed",
    "   Cons:",
    "   - Incomplete architecture (missing 4 layers)",
    "   - May create technical debt if not completed",
    "",
    "🎯 RECOMMENDED: Option C (Layer 0 only)",
    "   Rationale:",
    "   - Layer 0 is the meta-layer (most important)",
    "   - Provides 'Who watches the watchmen?' protection",
    "   - Small enough to complete in 1 week",
    "   - Layers 1-4 can be added incrementally",
    "   - Unblocks other roadmap items sooner"
