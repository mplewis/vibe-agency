Analyst: Claude Code

## Executive Summary

[3-4 sentences: What this system actually is]

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several key high-level directories, each with a distinct purpose.

- **`agency_os/`**: This appears to be the core of the system, containing the logic for different frameworks (planning, code generation, QA, deployment, maintenance). It is structured by numbered "frameworks" which seem to correspond to different stages of a workflow. Each framework contains agents, knowledge, and prompts. This is the "brain" of the VIBE Agency.

- **`bin/`**: Contains executable scripts for interacting with the system, performing checks, and managing workflows. These are the primary entry points for users or CI/CD systems.

- **`config/`**: Holds configuration files (`.yaml`, `.py`) for the system, including base configurations and environment-specific settings (dev, prod).

- **`docs/`**: A comprehensive documentation folder containing architecture documents (GADs, VADs, LADs), analysis reports, guides, and research. This directory seems to be well-maintained and extensive.

- **`lib/`**: Contains Python library code, including a `phoenix_config` module which suggests a custom configuration loading system.

- **`scripts/`**: A collection of Python scripts for various utility tasks like bootstrapping, validation, and integrity checks.

- **`system_steward_framework/`**: Seems to be a meta-level framework for system governance, containing agents like `AUDITOR` and `LEAD_ARCHITECT`, and knowledge about system architecture and SOPs.

- **`tests/`**: Contains a large number of tests, organized by unit, integration, e2e, and architecture. This indicates a strong emphasis on testing.

- **`workspaces/`**: Contains different project workspaces, each with its own `project_manifest.json`. This suggests a multi-tenant or multi-project capability.

- **`.github/`**: Contains GitHub-specific files, including workflows and PR templates.

- **Other key files**:
    - `pyproject.toml`: Defines Python project metadata and dependencies.
    - `Makefile`: Contains make targets for common tasks.
    - `vibe-cli`: An executable, likely the main command-line interface.

## Architecture Analysis

### Context Injection Engine

The context injection mechanism is a sophisticated, five-layer system designed for security and awareness, as detailed in `GAD-501.md`. It is far more than simply passing a prompt to a model.

1.  **Layer 0: System Integrity Verification**: This is the most impressive feature. Before any operation, the system verifies the checksums of its own core scripts and configuration files against a trusted manifest (`.vibe/system_integrity_manifest.json`). This "who watches the watchmen" approach prevents the system from running with a compromised regulatory framework.
2.  **Layer 1: Session Shell (`vibe-cli`)**: This is the primary user entry point. It guarantees that the Layer 0 integrity check runs on every boot. It also provides the user with immediate, high-level context about the system's state via a "Message of the Day" (MOTD).
3.  **Layer 2: Ambient Context**: The system maintains a "living" `project_manifest.json` that consolidates project state and system health. It also uses a "symbiotic files" pattern, where critical files contain checksums of each other, making unauthorized changes immediately obvious.
4.  **Layer 3: Commit Watermarking**: A `pre-commit` hook automatically injects a summary of the system's status (linting, tests, etc.) into every commit message, creating a permanent, traceable record of system health at the time of each commit.
5.  **Layer 4: Remote Validation**: CI/CD pipelines enforce the rules, providing a final, unavoidable validation gate that runs the integrity checks.

### Session Handoff Protocol

The handoff protocol is a well-defined, two-file system designed for both human- and machine-readability.

-   **`.session_handoff.json`**: This is a rich, structured JSON file that captures the "narrative" from the previous work session. It is governed by a schema (`config/schemas/session_handoff.schema.json`) and is structured in layers to provide both a quick summary (Layer 0/1) and deep technical details (Layer 2) for the next agent.
-   **`.system_status.json`**: This file is automatically generated and updated by `bin/update-system-status.sh`. It captures the objective, real-time state of the repository, including git status and test results.
-   **`show-context.py`**: This script is the consumer of the protocol. It reads both JSON files and presents a single, comprehensive, and human-readable report to the user, providing a complete picture of the project's status.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

The orchestration system is a true state machine, not a simple script. However, its name is somewhat misleading, as it does not currently orchestrate multiple *autonomous* agents.

-   **State-Driven:** The `core_orchestrator.py` acts as a state machine controller. It reads the `current_phase` from `project_manifest.json` and delegates execution to the appropriate phase handler (e.g., `PlanningHandler`, `CodingHandler`). This is a robust and scalable architecture.
-   **Delegated Execution Model:** The `README.md` implies autonomous agents, but the code reveals a **"delegated execution"** model. By default, the orchestrator's primary job is to *compose* the correct prompt for a given task. It then writes this prompt to a `request_...json` file and polls for a `response_...json` file to be created by an external operator (e.g., a human using the Claude Code IDE extension). The system provides the instructions; an outside force "turns the crank".
-   **Incomplete Phases:** The orchestration logic is sound, but the handlers for the `TESTING` and `MAINTENANCE` phases are currently stubs, meaning the SDLC workflow is not fully implemented end-to-end.
-   **Quality Gates:** The orchestrator integrates with the GAD-4 quality pillar. Before transitioning between phases, it can invoke the `AUDITOR` agent to perform checks, providing a sophisticated layer of self-governance.

## Sophisticated Features

Based on the analysis, several features stand out as particularly advanced or unique:

1.  **System Self-Verification (Layer 0):** The concept of the system cryptographically verifying its own regulatory components *before* execution is a powerful security and stability feature. It addresses the "who watches the watchmen" problem in a concrete way.
2.  **Delegated Execution Architecture:** While not fully autonomous, the clear separation between prompt composition (the system's job) and prompt execution (the operator's job) is a very deliberate and interesting design choice. It allows the system to leverage the power of external LLMs without being tightly coupled to a specific API, and it keeps a human-in-the-loop by design.
3.  **Layered Documentation (GAD/LAD/VAD):** The architecture is not just documented; it is documented in a three-dimensional system (Pillars, Layers, Verifications) that allows for a comprehensive understanding from multiple perspectives. This is a level of documentation rigor rarely seen.
4.  **Graceful Degradation:** The concept of the three deployment layers (Browser-only, Claude Code, Full Runtime) is a key strategic advantage. It allows the system to be useful even in limited environments and provides a clear path for progressive enhancement.
5.  **"Iron Dome" Safety Layer (GAD-509/510):** The integrated Circuit Breaker and Quota Manager provide a robust safety net against cascading failures and runaway costs, which is critical for any system that interacts with paid APIs.
6.  **Living Organism Metaphor:** The consistent and well-defined mapping of architectural components to a biological metaphor (Brain, Body, Arms, etc.) makes the complex system surprisingly intuitive to understand.

## Test Coverage Reality

The project has a significant number of tests, but the claims in the documentation are not accurate. The actual test results provide a more realistic picture of the system's maturity.

**Actual Test Metrics (from `bin/vibe-test --coverage`):**
- **Total Tests:** 589
- **Passed:** 576
- **Skipped:** 13
- **Coverage:** 59%

**Analysis:**

- **Inaccurate Documentation:** Both the `README.md` (claiming 519/532 passed, 52% coverage) and `GAD_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` (claiming 369/383 passed) have outdated and incorrect test metrics. The real numbers show more tests exist and pass than documented, and the coverage is slightly higher than claimed in the README.

- **What's Actually Tested:** The test suite is extensive, covering:
    - **Architecture:** GAD integrations and pillar interactions (`tests/architecture/`).
    - **Core Components:** The runtime (`vibe-shell`), orchestrator, state machine, and various handlers are well-tested.
    - **Workflows:** The planning, coding, and deployment workflows have dedicated tests.
    - **Unit Tests:** Individual components like the safety layer (circuit breaker, quota manager), personas, and utility modules have unit tests.

- **What's NOT Tested (The Skipped Tests):**
    - The 13 skipped tests are highly significant. The majority of them are in `tests/test_tool_use_e2e.py`.
    - The skip messages explicitly state that the Vibe CLI no longer directly executes tools, and that this functionality is delegated to the "Claude Code operator".
    - **This is direct evidence that GAD-3 (Agents) is not fully implemented.** The core capability of agents using tools within the workflow is not being tested because it's not implemented in the way it was originally designed. This supports the "Implementation Pending" status from `ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md` and contradicts the "DONE" status in the `README.md`.

In summary, while the project has a strong testing culture, the documentation has not kept pace with the reality of the test suite. The test results themselves reveal critical gaps in the implementation of the Agent framework (GAD-3).
