"""
Test Context Integration (OPERATION CONTEXT / GAD-909)
=======================================================

Verifies that the executor properly resolves dynamic context and injects
it into prompts.

This test verifies "The Flesh" - dynamic system data flowing through the skeleton:
- System Time
- Git Branch
- Git Status

The system should transform static prompt templates into living prompts
with real system data.
