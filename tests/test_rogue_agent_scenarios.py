GAD-502: Haiku Hardening - Rogue Agent Behavior Tests

Tests scenarios where less capable agents (Haiku or dumber) might:
1. Hallucinate commands/files
2. Bypass safety checks
3. Misinterpret error messages
4. Loop on failed operations
5. Ignore critical context

Purpose: Ensure system is "Haiku-proof" - even dumb agents can't break it.

SEMANTIC CLARIFICATION (2025-11-17):
"Haiku" in this context means:
- ✅ Claude Code operator using Haiku model (less capable than Sonnet)
- ✅ Testing delegation architecture with cheaper/faster models
- ❌ NOT direct Haiku API integration (forbidden in MVP)

The system delegates to Claude Code operator - the operator chooses their model.
These tests validate that the DELEGATION architecture works regardless of
which model the operator chooses.

This work package spans the spectrum:
- GAD-004: Validates quality enforcement works (adversarial testing)
- GAD-005: Hardens runtime guardrails (kernel, MOTD, errors)
- Final enforcement: CI/CD wipe if runtime fails
