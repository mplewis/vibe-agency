# CLAUDE.md - Operational Truth Protocol

**Version:** 2.0
**Purpose:** Prevent hallucination. Show REAL operational status, not design intent.
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-15

---

## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLES (Never Change)

1. **Don't trust "Complete ✅" without passing tests**
2. **Test first, then claim complete**
3. **When docs contradict code, trust code**
4. **When code contradicts tests, trust tests**
5. **When in doubt: RUN THE VERIFICATION COMMAND**

---

## 📖 What This Repo Is

**vibe-agency** = File-based prompt framework for AI-assisted software project planning.

**Architecture Reference:** See [ARCHITECTURE_V2.md](./ARCHITECTURE_V2.md) for conceptual model.

**Core Flow (MVP - DELEGATION ONLY):**
```
Claude Code (operator) ← STDOUT/STDIN → vibe-cli → Core Orchestrator → SDLC Phases → Agents
```

**Note:** vibe-cli delegates intelligence requests to Claude Code operator.
See: docs/architecture/EXECUTION_MODE_STRATEGY.md

**5 SDLC Phases:**
1. PLANNING (4 sub-states: RESEARCH → BUSINESS_VALIDATION → FEATURE_SPECIFICATION → ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN)
2. CODING (5-phase code generation workflow)
3. TESTING (stub - transitions only)
4. DEPLOYMENT (stub - transitions only)
5. MAINTENANCE (stub - transitions only)

## 🔍 HOW TO VERIFY CLAIMS

### Verify PLANNING Phase Works
```bash
python tests/test_planning_workflow.py
# Expected: All tests pass (state machine + transitions)
```

### Verify CODING Handler Works (E2E Tests Pass)
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_coding_workflow.py -v
# Expected: 3 tests pass (test_coding_phase_execution, test_missing_feature_spec, test_quality_gates_failure)
```

### Verify vibe-cli Has Tool Use Loop
```bash
grep -n "tool_use\|tool_result" vibe-cli | head -10
# Expected: Multiple matches in lines 426-497
```

### Verify Research Tools Dependencies
```bash
python3 -c "import bs4" 2>/dev/null && echo "✅ bs4 installed" || echo "❌ bs4 missing"
# Expected: ✅ bs4 installed
```

### Verify Prompt Registry Works
```bash
python tests/test_prompt_registry.py
# Expected: All tests pass (governance injection)
```

## 🧪 META-TEST (Self-Verification)

**Can you trust THIS document?**

Run this to verify CLAUDE.md claims match reality:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "=== CLAUDE.md Self-Verification ==="

# Test 1: PLANNING really works
python3 -m pytest tests/test_planning_workflow.py && echo "✅ PLANNING verified" || echo "❌ PLANNING claim FALSE"

# Test 2: CODING handler E2E tests pass
python3 -m pytest tests/test_coding_workflow.py && echo "✅ CODING verified" || echo "❌ CODING claim FALSE"

# Test 3: vibe-cli has tool loop
grep -q "tool_use" vibe-cli && grep -q "tool_result" vibe-cli && \
  echo "✅ vibe-cli has tool support" || echo "❌ vibe-cli missing tool loop"

# Test 4: bs4 dependency
python3 -c "import bs4" 2>/dev/null && \
  echo "✅ bs4 installed" || echo "❌ bs4 missing (pip install beautifulsoup4)"

# Test 5: Prompt Registry
python3 -m pytest tests/test_prompt_registry.py 2>&1 | grep -q "passed" && \
  echo "✅ Prompt Registry verified" || echo "❌ Prompt Registry not tested"
```

**If ANY test fails, CLAUDE.md is out of date or system is broken.**

## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES (As of 2025-11-15 22:39 UTC)

### 1. No vibe-cli End-to-End Test
**Issue:** Tool use loop (Lines 426-497) never tested with real API
**Impact:** Unknown if multi-turn tool execution works
**Fix:** Write `test_vibe_cli_tool_loop.py` with mock API
**Verify:** `find tests -name "*vibe_cli*"`

### 2. Complexity Near Threshold
**Issue:** `core_orchestrator.py` complexity near max (14/15 on some functions)
**Impact:** Future changes may trigger complexity violations
**Fix:** Monitor and refactor if needed
**Verify:** `python3 -m ruff check agency_os/00_system/orchestrator/core_orchestrator.py`

### 3. Documentation Drift (Non-Critical)
**Issue:** 19 files with `pip install` (should be `uv sync`)
**Impact:** Confusion for developers using old documentation
**Fix:** Update archive documentation files
**Status:** Deferred until after portfolio test

## 🚫 ANTI-PATTERNS (What NOT to Do)

### ❌ Don't Trust Docs Without Verification
```
BAD:  "README says complete → I assume it works"
GOOD: "README says complete → I run the test → Test missing → Status is 'untested'"
```

### ❌ Don't Confuse "Code Exists" with "Works"
```
BAD:  "coding_handler.py has 211 lines → CODING works"
GOOD: "coding_handler.py has 211 lines AND test_coding_workflow.py passes → CODING works"
```

### ❌ Don't Propose Features That Already Exist
```
BAD:  "We need a tool use loop in vibe-cli"
GOOD: "vibe-cli has tool loop (L426-497) but needs E2E test"
```

### ❌ Don't Add "Future Vision" to CLAUDE.md
```
BAD:  "Phase 4 TODO: Implement XYZ"
GOOD: "XYZ not implemented: no code in expected location"
```

---

## 🎯 QUICK START (For New AI Assistants)

### Before Making Claims
```bash
# 1. Verify structure
ls -la agency_os/01_planning_framework/agents/

# 2. Check knowledge bases
wc -l agency_os/01_planning_framework/knowledge/*.yaml

# 3. Run tests to see what works
python tests/test_planning_workflow.py
python tests/test_research_agent_e2e.py  # Will fail: bs4 missing

# 4. Read honest assessment
cat ARCHITECTURE_V2.md  # Conceptual model
```

### When User Says "X is broken"
1. Run verification command from tables above
2. Read test output (don't just trust "FAILED")
3. Check actual error (e.g., "bs4 missing" vs "no integration layer")
4. Distinguish infrastructure issue from design gap

### When User Says "Implement X"
1. Search codebase first: `find . -name "*X*"`
2. Check if X already exists but is untested
3. Check ARCHITECTURE_V2.md for intended design
4. Only claim "missing" if no code exists

## 📚 Related Documents

- **[ARCHITECTURE_V2.md](./ARCHITECTURE_V2.md)** - Conceptual architecture (the "should be")
- **[SSOT.md](./SSOT.md)** - Implementation decisions (the "is")
- **Test files in `tests/`** - Source of truth for "works" claims

**Document Hierarchy:**
1. **Tests** = Ultimate truth (passing = works, missing = unknown)
2. **Code** = Implementation truth (exists = implemented, missing = todo)
3. **CLAUDE.md (this file)** = Operational snapshot (dated, expect drift)
4. **ARCHITECTURE_V2.md** = Conceptual model (intended design)
5. **Other docs** = May be outdated (verify before trusting)

| ⚠️ Stub | Minimal implementation | Allows transitions but no real functionality |
| ❌ Broken | Test fails | Known issue, see Known Issues section |
| ❌ Missing | No code found | Not implemented, no files in expected location |
