# CLAUDE.md - Operational Truth Protocol

**Version:** 2.0
**Purpose:** Prevent hallucination. Show REAL operational status, not design intent.
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-15

## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLES (Never Change)

1. **Don't trust "Complete ✅" without passing tests**
2. **Test first, then claim complete**
3. **When docs contradict code, trust code**
4. **When code contradicts tests, trust tests**
5. **When in doubt: RUN THE VERIFICATION COMMAND**

---

## 📖 What This Repo Is

**vibe-agency** = File-based prompt framework for AI-assisted software project planning.

**Architecture Reference:** See [ARCHITECTURE_V2.md](./ARCHITECTURE_V2.md) for conceptual model.

**Core Flow (MVP - DELEGATION ONLY):**
```
Claude Code (operator) ← STDOUT/STDIN → vibe-cli → Core Orchestrator → SDLC Phases → Agents
```

**Note:** vibe-cli delegates intelligence requests to Claude Code operator.
See: docs/architecture/EXECUTION_MODE_STRATEGY.md

**5 SDLC Phases:**
1. PLANNING (4 sub-states: RESEARCH → BUSINESS_VALIDATION → FEATURE_SPECIFICATION → ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN)
2. CODING (5-phase code generation workflow)
3. TESTING (stub - transitions only)
4. DEPLOYMENT (stub - transitions only)
5. MAINTENANCE (stub - transitions only)

## 🔍 HOW TO VERIFY CLAIMS

### Verify PLANNING Phase Works
```bash
python tests/test_planning_workflow.py
# Expected: All tests pass (state machine + transitions)
```

### Verify CODING Handler Exists (Not Just Placeholder)
```bash
wc -l agency_os/00_system/orchestrator/handlers/coding_handler.py
# Expected: >200 lines (211 as of 2025-11-15)
```

### Verify vibe-cli Has Tool Use Loop
```bash
grep -n "tool_use\|tool_result" vibe-cli | head -10
# Expected: Multiple matches in lines 426-497
```

### Verify Research Tools Dependencies
```bash
python -c "import bs4" 2>/dev/null && echo "✅ bs4 installed" || echo "❌ bs4 missing"
# Expected: bs4 missing (install: pip install beautifulsoup4)
```

### Verify Prompt Registry Works
```bash
python tests/test_prompt_registry.py
# Expected: All tests pass (governance injection)
```

## 🧪 META-TEST (Self-Verification)

**Can you trust THIS document?**

Run this to verify CLAUDE.md claims match reality:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "=== CLAUDE.md Self-Verification ==="

# Test 1: PLANNING really works
python tests/test_planning_workflow.py && echo "✅ PLANNING verified" || echo "❌ PLANNING claim FALSE"

# Test 2: CODING handler exists (not stub)
[ $(wc -l < agency_os/00_system/orchestrator/handlers/coding_handler.py) -gt 50 ] && \
  echo "✅ CODING has implementation" || echo "❌ CODING is stub"

# Test 3: vibe-cli has tool loop
grep -q "tool_use" vibe-cli && grep -q "tool_result" vibe-cli && \
  echo "✅ vibe-cli has tool support" || echo "❌ vibe-cli missing tool loop"

# Test 4: bs4 dependency
python -c "import bs4" 2>/dev/null && \
  echo "✅ bs4 installed" || echo "❌ bs4 missing (pip install beautifulsoup4)"

# Test 5: Prompt Registry
python tests/test_prompt_registry.py 2>&1 | grep -q "PASSED" && \
  echo "✅ Prompt Registry verified" || echo "❌ Prompt Registry not tested"
```

**If ANY test fails, CLAUDE.md is out of date or system is broken.**

## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES (As of 2025-11-15)

### 1. Missing Dependencies
**Issue:** `bs4` (beautifulsoup4) not in requirements.txt
**Impact:** Research agents with tools fail
**Fix:** `pip install beautifulsoup4`
**Verify:** `python -c "import bs4"`

### 2. No CODING End-to-End Test
**Issue:** No `test_coding_workflow.py` exists
**Impact:** CODING handler (211 lines) never tested end-to-end
**Fix:** Write test similar to `test_planning_workflow.py`
**Verify:** `ls tests/test_coding_workflow.py`

### 3. No vibe-cli End-to-End Test
**Issue:** Tool use loop (Lines 426-497) never tested with real API
**Impact:** Unknown if multi-turn tool execution works
**Fix:** Write `test_vibe_cli_tool_loop.py` with mock API
**Verify:** `find tests -name "*vibe_cli*"`

### 4. Stubs Labeled as "Fully Implemented"
**Issue:** Some docs claim CODING "fully implemented" (true) but imply tested (false)
**Impact:** Misleading status - code exists but zero E2E tests
**Fix:** This document distinguishes "code exists" vs "works"

---

## 🚫 ANTI-PATTERNS (What NOT to Do)

### ❌ Don't Trust Docs Without Verification
```
BAD:  "README says complete → I assume it works"
GOOD: "README says complete → I run the test → Test missing → Status is 'untested'"
```

### ❌ Don't Confuse "Code Exists" with "Works"
```
BAD:  "coding_handler.py has 211 lines → CODING works"
GOOD: "coding_handler.py has 211 lines → CODING implemented, needs E2E test"
```

### ❌ Don't Propose Features That Already Exist
```
BAD:  "We need a tool use loop in vibe-cli"
GOOD: "vibe-cli has tool loop (L426-497) but needs E2E test"
```

### ❌ Don't Add "Future Vision" to CLAUDE.md
```
BAD:  "Phase 4 TODO: Implement XYZ"
GOOD: "XYZ not implemented: no code in expected location"
```

## 🎯 QUICK START (For New AI Assistants)

### Before Making Claims
```bash
# 1. Verify structure
ls -la agency_os/01_planning_framework/agents/

# 2. Check knowledge bases
wc -l agency_os/01_planning_framework/knowledge/*.yaml

# 3. Run tests to see what works
python tests/test_planning_workflow.py
python tests/test_research_agent_e2e.py  # Will fail: bs4 missing

# 4. Read honest assessment
cat ARCHITECTURE_V2.md  # Conceptual model
```

### When User Says "X is broken"
1. Run verification command from tables above
2. Read test output (don't just trust "FAILED")
3. Check actual error (e.g., "bs4 missing" vs "no integration layer")
4. Distinguish infrastructure issue from design gap

### When User Says "Implement X"
1. Search codebase first: `find . -name "*X*"`
2. Check if X already exists but is untested
3. Check ARCHITECTURE_V2.md for intended design
4. Only claim "missing" if no code exists

## 📚 Related Documents

- **[ARCHITECTURE_V2.md](./ARCHITECTURE_V2.md)** - Conceptual architecture (the "should be")
- **[SSOT.md](./SSOT.md)** - Implementation decisions (the "is")
- **Test files in `tests/`** - Source of truth for "works" claims

**Document Hierarchy:**
1. **Tests** = Ultimate truth (passing = works, missing = unknown)
2. **Code** = Implementation truth (exists = implemented, missing = todo)
3. **CLAUDE.md (this file)** = Operational snapshot (dated, expect drift)
4. **ARCHITECTURE_V2.md** = Conceptual model (intended design)
5. **Other docs** = May be outdated (verify before trusting)

|--------|---------|------------|
| ✅ Works | Has passing test | Can execute NOW, verified |
| ⚠️ Untested | Code exists, no test | Implementation present, never verified end-to-end |
| ⚠️ Stub | Minimal implementation | Allows transitions but no real functionality |
| ❌ Broken | Test fails | Known issue, see Known Issues section |
| ❌ Missing | No code found | Not implemented, no files in expected location |
